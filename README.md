# INTRODUCTION
This project explores the "80 Cereals" dataset, which contains detailed nutritional information about 80 different breakfast cereals. Sourced from Kaggle, this dataset provides an excellent opportunity to delve into the nutritional content of popular cereals. The primary goals of this project are to gain insights into the nutritional profiles of these cereals, identify trends and patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions that could inform healthier dietary choices and better product understanding.

# CONTENT
Based on the 80 cereals dataset from Kaggle, This cereal dataset contains various variables and fields to consider. They include:
1.  Name: The name of the cereal.
2.  MFR:  The manufacturer of the cereal.
3.  Type: Type i.e hot or cold.
4.  Calories: Number of calories per serving.
5.  Protein: Grams of protein per serving.
6.  Fat: Grams of fat per serving.
7.  Sodium: Milligrams of sodium per servin.
8.  Fiber: Grams of fiber per serving.
9.  Carbo: Grams of carbohydrates per servin.
10. Sugar: Grams of sugars per serving.
11. Potass: Milligrams of potassium per serving.
12. Vitamin: Percentage of recommended daily vitamins.
13. Shelf: Display shelf (1, 2, or 3, counting from the floor).
14. Weight: Weight in ounces of one serving.
15. Cups: Number of cups in one serving.
16. Ratings: A rating of the cereal.

# OBJECTIVES
1.  Show do different manufacturers (mfr) compare in terms of average calories, protein, fat, and fiber in their cereals?
2.  Are there a correlation between the nutritional content (calories, protein, fat, fiber) and the rating of cereals?
3.  What is the distribution of cereal types (hot vs cold) in the dataset.
4.  What are the top 5 cereals based on their rating?
5.  Which cereals have the highest and lowest sodium content?
6.  Do cereals placed on different shelves (shelf 1, 2, 3) have different ratings?
7.  Is there a relationship between sugars and carbohydrates in cereals?
8.  How does the nutrient composition (calories, protein, fat, etc.) vary by serving size (weight)?
9.  Create histograms or box plots to visualize the distribution of nutrients (calories, protein, fat, etc.) across all cereals.
10. Visualize the top-rated cereals based on user ratings.
